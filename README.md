# EDA-and-Feature-Engineering-Mass-Shootings-in-the-USA-

This is a "python for data science" course project in which we got to pick a dataset, ask a research question, and run an exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to answer it. Dataset was cleaned, visualized and results were discussed.

Coming from the psychology field, I found the profile of a mass shooter in the USA interesting.
