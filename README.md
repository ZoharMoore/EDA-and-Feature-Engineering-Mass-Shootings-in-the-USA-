# EDA-and-Feature-Engineering-Mass-Shootings-in-the-USA-

A python for data science course project in which a research question is asked over a dataset and is answered using an EDA and feature engineering. 
Coming from the field of psychology, I wanted to understand better who commits mass shooting in the usa and create a profile for them and determine whether a history of mental illness plays a contributing role.
